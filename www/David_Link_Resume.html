<p>I am a builder.  I am a software developer.  I build stable reliable automated systems which run businesses, analyze data, integrate disparate systems, and control process workflows.  The systems I build are robust and stand on their own, allowing business users to control and maintain them.</p>

<p>I have an elegant approach to problem solving which enriches the companies I work for.  An ounce of good design can be worth a million dollars a few years down the road.  I pay attention to details, and study complex problems so they can be express as a set of simpler ones.</p>
 
<p>My understanding of Technology, the use of Analysis, Design, Planning, Agile Development, and Team building, together with strong Communication Skills make me a great asset to any development team.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
I manage complex projects to successful completion.  This benefits the users of those systems as well as the bottom line.
My success as a project manager comes from my organizational skills, my documentation skills, and the ability to disseminate information to both business leaders and team members.  I lead by example by creating quality and demonstrating a good work ethic.  My philosophy is "let the best idea win", which means being open to hearing all ideas.

        <h3>MyPublisher.com</h3>
        2006 - 2010<br/>
        Valhalla, NY
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Data Architect / Senior Programmer</strong>
        of MyPublisher.com, Custom Photo Book publishing company.
    </p>
    <p>
        My team designed, developed and maintained all aspects of book manufacturing, reporting and accounting. The Plant System includes an automated
manufacturing workflow engine, resource management, and batch job processing. It has a very well designed <strong>Data Model</strong> and        <strong>Object Model</strong>.<strong> </strong>Our <strong>Intranet</strong> reporting system integrates all of manufacturing. We also designed and
        built our <strong>Online Bookshelf</strong> Web Application which includes a <strong>Web 2.0</strong> Bookviewer Application.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Plant System is built in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong>, and <strong>HTML</strong>, running on <strong>Linux</strong>. It manages
over 30 Terabytes of customer and manufacturing data. The Bookshelf System is built in <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Flash</strong> and        <strong>HTML</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Plant System is designed and written in a clear cohesive manner, that has been invaluable to the company. First it allows us to be agile and change
        to business and marketing needs quickly. Second it allows new engineers to come in and hit the ground running with little to no ramping up required.
        And lastly, it provides stable functionality that MyPublisher.com relies on to compete in the market place.

        <h3>Nielsen Entertainment at VNU, Inc.</h3>
        2001 - 2006<br/>
        White Plains, NY
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Software Architect / DBA</strong>
        of Nielsen Videoscan, a subscription based <strong>Web Application</strong> for reporting and analysis of Movie Video retail data with multi million
dollar client base in Hollywood. There are two US systems and one for Canada, each running on the same <strong>Code Set</strong> and        <strong>Database Schema</strong> but with different Database Data.
    </p>
    <p>
My responsibilities included the full development life cycle of these products from conception to market. I developed the systems on an<strong>Open Source Tool Stack</strong> consisting of <strong>Perl CGI</strong> on <strong>Apache</strong>, using the<strong>PostgreSQL Database </strong>on <strong>Linux</strong>. I then migrated the product to <strong>Mod Perl</strong>. The        <strong>Data Model</strong> is in <strong>Third Normal Form</strong> but is also <strong>Denormalized</strong> where necessary for performance. The
        largest of the three systems is 125 Gigabytes on disk. <strong>SQL</strong> Access is contained within an <strong>Object Data Layer</strong>. The most
        sophisticated component of the system is a <strong>Web Based Data Warehouse Query</strong> facility that does not require a browser plug-in on the
        client side.
    </p>
    <p>
I used of <strong>CPAN modules</strong>: <em>CGI</em>, <em>DBI</em>, <em>HTML::Table</em>, <em>Relations::Query</em>, <em>POSIX</em>,        <em>Spreadsheet::WriteExcel</em>, and <em>Apache::Htpasswd</em>. We also use <strong>DHTML</strong> via <strong>Javascript</strong>. Very important to
        us was the <strong>CVS source code repository</strong> which allows control of <strong>release cycles</strong> as well as allowing many developers to
work independently on the system at the same time. I used <strong>UML diagrams</strong> to communicate new design specifications to developers. For        <strong>Linux</strong> distribution, we have used <strong>Mandrake</strong>, <strong>Redhat</strong> and <strong>SUSE</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Addition I built an in house application used to help our analysts support the main systems from a central database of common attributes. This is
        written using <strong>PHP</strong> with <strong>Apache</strong> and the <strong>MySQL</strong> <strong>Database</strong> on <strong>Linux</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was hired to help transition the existing development staff from <strong>ISAM based technology</strong> to <strong>Database technology</strong>. I am
        proud to say this was fully accomplished, and new development at Nielsen Entertainment is now
    </p>
    <p>
done in <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong> on <strong>Apache 2.0</strong> with either <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> or        <strong>MySQL Databases</strong> on <strong>Linux</strong>.
